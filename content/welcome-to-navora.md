This isn’t just another blog. It’s a curated space where we explore the design and implementation of systems that are scalable, resilient, and thoughtfully engineered. Each series within *The Architect’s Workshop* dives deep into specific architectural challenges or domains, simulating real-world scenarios and walking through the decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned that, hopefully shape good systems.

Whether you’re an aspiring architect, a senior engineer, or simply someone passionate about building better software, I hope you get something out of these workshops.

# Series 1: Navora — Simulating a Real-World Architecture Journey

On our first series, we will introduce Navora, a logistics company with a fleet of delivery vehicles that has real time monitoring. This is a fictional but realistic project designed to simulate the full lifecycle of a modern cloud-native system — from development to deployment, infrastructure to observability.

In this series, we’ll explore:

- How to define and fulfill both functional and non-functional requirements.
   
- Designing modular, scalable architecture.
    
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code.
    
- Building and integrating services like telemetry ingestion, alerting, and admin tools.
    
- And ultimately, reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and most importantly what we learned.
    

## What to expect in this first series

This blog series will walk through the journey of building Navora, one step at a time. Each post will focus on a specific aspect of the project — from infrastructure design to service communication, from CI/CD to monitoring.

Here’s a sneak peek at what’s coming in the next posts:

- Laying the Foundation — Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
    
- Streaming the Signal: Designing the IoT Telemetry Ingestion Pipeline
    
- Detect and Respond: Architecting the Alerts Processing Service
    
- Control Center: Designing the Admin Service for Telemetry Management
    
- Reflections on Architecture, Trade-offs, and What I’d Do Differently
    

I hope to see you in our next post when we breakdown functional and non-functional requirements.

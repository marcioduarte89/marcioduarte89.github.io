    "description": "The journey from raw Markdown notes to being able to chat with my notes begins with a parser. In the MindLog pipeline, the parser is the gatekeeper: it ensures that notes from the knowledge base are consistently extracted, segmented, and enriched before they ever reach the embedding stage.",

    "description": "Every system starts with a problem to solve. For Mindlog, that problem is clear - while tools like Obsidian are excellent for capturing and organizing notes, they don’t easily support AI-driven search, aggregation, or deeper insights. This opening article introduces sets out the vision for Mindlog, an AI-augmented knowledge base. It covers the challenges of moving beyond static note-taking, the guiding principles behind the solution, and the high-level architecture that ties Obsidian, embeddings, vector databases, MCP, and Claude into a cohesive system.",
